1	Oatmeal, coconut and almond cookies	Preheat oven to 350 F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper and set aside.In a mixing bowl add all of the ingredients. Combine with a rubber spatula and/or using your hands to mix throughly, I use my hands towards the end :-) (You may need to add a couple more tablespoons of milk to the dough to make sure it sticks together)Place spoonfuls of cookies 2 inches apart, as they will expand during baking, and flatten slightly with a fork or your fingers.Bake for 12-15 minutes or until they begin to brown around the edges. Cool cookies in cookie sheets for about 5 minutes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.	45	Regular	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/553331-556x370.jpg	5

7	Gluten-Free Fried Okra (Yep, I fried it!)	**If you want to keep the fried okra warm in the oven, preheat it to 225 degrees.Prepare a sheet pan by lining it with waxed paper.In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk.  In a separate bowl, mix together the cornmeal, rice flour, salt, and pepper.  Add the sliced okra to the milk mixture, then move it to the cornmeal mixture and toss it around to coat.  It’s ok to get your hands in the mix – it works better that way.  Move breaded okra to the lined sheet pan.  Repeat until all of the okra has been breaded.Heat oil in an enameled cast-iron dutch oven (I used my 6 quart dutch oven but a smaller one would work.) until the temperature reaches 375 degrees on a candy thermometer.  Transfer about 1/3 – 1/2 of the okra to the hot oil, depending on how large your skillet it, with a slotted spoon or mesh frying spoon.  Let cook until golden brown, about 2 – 3 minutes.  Transfer to a plate lined with a double layer of paper towels.  Once it has drained, you can move that to an oven-safe crock and keep it warm if desired.	45	Vegetarian, glutenFree	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/539716-556x370.png	18
8	Brown Sugar Mustard Glazed Ham	Preheat the oven to 300F | 150C and arrange a rack in the lower third. Remove any plastic packaging or netting from the ham. Trim away the rind and discard. Set the ham aside to rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours.Line a baking tray or dish with several sheets of aluminium foil or parchment paper if you prefer (it will make cleanup a lot easier). Remove the rind or skin of the ham (refer to steps in post), ensuring you leave the fat on. Using a sharp knife score a 1-inch-wide diamond pattern (dont cut more than 1/4 inch deep) over the entire ham. Place the ham in the baking tray; pour 1/3 cup of water into the base of the pan and cover the ham with two pieces of foil or parchment paper and bake for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the butter in a small pot or saucepan over medium heat until golden browned. Add in the brown sugar, honey, mustard, cinnamon and cloves, stirring to mix together well until the brown sugar has completely dissolved, (about 2 minutes). Reduce heat to low and add in the garlic. Allow it to become fragrant, cooking for a further minute or two until the glaze just begins to simmer, then set it aside and let cool to lukewarm (the glaze should be the consistency of room-temperature honey).After 30 minutes baking time, carefully remove the ham from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 425F | 220C. Discard the foil or parchment paper and pour 1/3 of the glaze all over the ham, brushing in between the cuts to evenly cover. Return to the oven and bake uncovered for 15 minutes.Remove from the oven, brush with another third of the glaze and some of the pan juices, and repeat again after 15 minutes more minutes of baking until a dark golden-brown crust has formed, (about 30 minutes total). For added depth of flavour, mix some of the ham pan juices together with the glaze in the pot which will help keep it runny enough for brushing. If your crust is still pink after there suggested baking time, turn on your broiler (or oven grill), and allow it to broil for 2-5 minutes, while keeping an eye on it so it doesn't burn from the sugar. Let the ham rest 10-20 minutes before slicing.	90	GlutenFree	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/954699-556x370.jpg	14
9	Chocolate Belgian Waffles	Heat lightly greased Belgian waffle maker.

Add milk, sour cream, eggs and vanilla; mix well.  Stir in chocolate mixture.

19	Spicy Pulled Pork Ramen	First, if you want to cook pork specifically for this recipe, I recommend this oven roasted version or this slow cooker version.Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the butter. Once melted, add the mushrooms and garlic and toss. Cook until the mushrooms are soft and juicy, about 5 minutes. Set aside.While the mushrooms are cooking, bring the stock to a simmer. Stir in the soy sauce and hoisin sauce. Cook your eggs too! I like to soft boil mine - but poaching is good too. Place the ramen blocks in two large bowls. Add the pork, scallions and a few cucumber slices to each bowl. Pour the stock over both blocks evenly and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes before stirring. Add mushrooms to each bowl and stir in a few more cucumber slices. At this point you could separate into two more bowls if you want 4 servings. Stir in the chili garlic paste (I do about a tablespoon per bowl for SPICY!) and add your egg and nori sheets. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and drizzle with toasted sesame oil. Serve immediately.	30	Regular	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/692590-556x370.jpg	11
20	Mini Vanilla Scones with Vanilla Bean Glaze	For the scones: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Split the vanilla beans in half lengthwise and scrape out all the vanilla "caviar" inside. Stir the caviar into the cream. Set aside for 15 minutes.                          Sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut the cold butter into pats, and then use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the butter into the flour. Keep going until the mixture resembles crumbs.                          Mix the vanilla cream with the egg, and then combine with the flour mixture. Stir gently with a fork just until it comes together.                          Turn the dough onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle. (Mixture will be pretty crumbly.) Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 12-by-7 inches and 1/2-to-3/4-inches thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. Then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical squares/rectangles. Next, cut each square/rectangle in half diagonally, to form two triangles. Transfer to a parchment or baking-mat-lined cookie sheet and bake for 18 minutes, removing from the oven just before they start to turn golden. Allow to cool for 15 minutes on the cookie sheet, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.                          For the glaze: Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape out the caviar. Stir the caviar into the milk. Set aside for 15 minutes.                          Mix the powdered sugar and salt with the vanilla milk, adding more powdered sugar or milk if necessary to get the right consistency. Stir or whisk until completely smooth.                          One at a time, carefully dunk each cooled scone in the glaze, turning it over if necessary. Transfer to parchment paper or the cooling rack. Allow the glaze to set completely, about an hour. Scones will keep several days if glazed.	130	Vegetarian	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/324254-556x370.jpeg	13

22	Potato-Cheese Pierogi with Sauerkraut	To prepare dough: Whisk whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour and 2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl. Whisk 1/3 cup oil and eggs in a small bowl. Add to the dry ingredients along with 1 cup warm water and stir to combine. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring, until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms. Knead a couple of times in the bowl. Shape into 3 disks, wrap each in plastic wrap and chill for 1 hour.To prepare filling: Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook until very tender, 15 to 17 minutes.Meanwhile, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.When the potatoes are done, drain well and return to the pan. Mash the potatoes with cottage cheese, then stir in the onion, sauerkraut, Cheddar, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper.To prepare pierogi: Put a large pot of water on to boil. Coat 1 large baking sheet with cooking spray; place next to the stove. Very generously dust 2 more large baking sheets with flour.Place a small bowl of water and the pierogi filling near your work area. Roll out one disk of dough on a well-floured surface until its about 1/16 inch thick (an approximate 16-by-20-inch oval). Using a 3 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out dough. Cover the dough scraps with a clean kitchen towel. Moisten the edges of each round with water. Place a level tablespoon of the filling in the center of each round. Fold the dough over the filling and press the edges (the pierogi will be very full); crimp with a fork to seal completely. Place on a floured baking sheet. Repeat this process with the two remaining disks of dough. Then repeat with the dough scraps, rerolling them as needed to make enough pierogi to use up all the filling (48-50 total). Discard any remaining dough.Cook the pierogi in 5 batches in the boiling water until they float to the top. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the baking sheet coated with cooking spray, letting water drain off from the spoon before transferring them.Preheat oven to 200F.Heat 1 tablespoon each oil and water in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 8 to 10 pierogi and cook until browned on both sides, 6 to 10 minutes total. Transfer to a baking sheet and keep warm in the oven while you prepare the rest. Add 8 to 10 more pierogi to the pan, drizzle in 1 tablespoon each oil and water and shake the pan to loosen the pierogi. Cook until browned on both sides; reduce the heat as necessary to prevent overbrowning. Repeat with the remaining pierogi, oil and water.Serve sprinkled with parsley, if desired.	180	Vegetarian, veryPopular	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/696349-556x370.jpg	11

33	Raw Hazelnut Chocolate Brownies	In your food processor, process the hazelnuts until finely ground. Add the dates, cocoa powder, maple syrup and vanilla and process until a sticky dough forms. Place the dough between two Silpats or pieces of parchment paper and roll out to about ¼ of an inch thick (or really, however thick you want it). Cut them however you like (I used 1½" circular cookie cutters) and form the excess dough into a ball, roll out again and cut out more shapes. For the frosting, in the bowl of your food processor, combine all the ingredients until thoroughly combined and no chunks of avocado are left. It took me a few minutes to do this but it was possible. If it's not sweet enough, add more maple syrup. The espresso flavor was really light even with quite a bit of powder, but I still liked the difference it made. Add the frosting to the cake and store in the fridge.	10	Vegetarian, vegan, glutenFree, dairyFree, veryPopular	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/480552-556x370.jpg	15

Once the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 400 degrees with the racks in the upper and lower thirds, and line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.7. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and cut into 4 equal pieces.8. Lightly dust your hands with flour, then gently roll and stretch 1 piece of dough to form a 12-inch-long rope.9. Flatten dough and arrange so a long side is nearest you, then roll out to a roughly 12- by 4-inch rectangle with a lightly floured rolling pin.10. Gently press about 1/4th of the cheese into lower third of rectangle, leaving a 1/2-inch border along bottom edge.11. Stretch bottom edge of dough up over filling and press tightly to seal, then roll up as tightly as possible to form a rope.12. Cut the rope into 12 pieces, squeezing the dough around the cheese on either side to tightly seal the pretzel bite and transfer to your prepared pan.13. Repeat the process, making three more ropes with remaining dough and cheese and cut into pieces, transferring to the prepared baking pans.14. Let the pretzel bites rest at room temperature, uncovered, about 30 minutes.15. Meanwhile, the six cups of water to a boil in a Dutch oven or large saucepan.16.

40	Sunrise Smoothie	I like to buy all of my fruits and veggies, and portion them at home so I can quickly grab what I need to make one smoothie each morning. I like to measure out all of the berries and one banana into a resealable bag, and freeze the ingredients overnight. I also portion out the kale and spinach into one bag and store them in the refrigerator (you can freeze these as well in one bag with the fruit).I usually brew some tea in the morning, and cool it down with some ice cubes so I can use it in the smoothie that day, and any extra I keep in the refrigerator for the next day.The first trick is to add all of your spinach and kale into the blender. Add the ½ cup of coconut water and ½ cup of green tea. Blend the vegetables until the mixture is bright green and only smaller particles are visible. This ensures that your have break down the vegetables before you add the frozen berries, so your smoothie doesn’t lose it’s nice thickness.Add berries to the pureed vegetables and blend until you get the desired consistency. The smoothie will be as sweet as your berries, so if you like a sweeter drink, you can add some natural sweetneers such as a touch of honey, agave or stevia. If you’re a little hesitant about how spinach or kale may taste, you can adjust the amounts you to your liking, but I promise that you can barely taste the vegetables!This recipe yields approximately 24 ounces of smoothie.	10	Vegetarian, vegan, glutenFree, dairyFree	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/534079-556x370.jpg	0

55	Chinese Stuffed Peppers, Classic Dim Sum	Use a cleaver or knife to finely mince the shrimp into a very fine paste. This process entails chopping and folding the shrimp paste over and onto itself, and continuing to chop. Transfer the shrimp paste to a bowl.\nChop the scallions. Set aside half of the green portion for the sauce. Add the rest of the chopped scallion to the shrimp, along with 1 teaspoon salt, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil,  teaspoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoons cornstarch, 2 teaspoons Shaoxing wine, and white pepper to taste. Use a fork to beat/whip the shrimp until it is smooth and all the ingredients are well-combined.\nPop the stems off the bell peppers and follow the lines of each pepper to cut into 3-5 segments. Remove the seeds. If using long hot green peppers, just cut them in half lengthwise and remove the seeds.\nStuff each pepper segment with the shrimp mixture until the filling is even with the edges of the peppers. You can also trim the ends of the peppers to ensure they are flush and at the same level of the filling. This will make the peppers easier to cook.\nHeat a tablespoon of oil in a wok or skillet over medium high heat and place the peppers in the oil, stuffing side down. Cook until they are browned, about 2 minutes. Turn the peppers over to sear the bottoms for another 2 minutes, turning the heat down if they start to get too dark. If using the long hot green peppers or another variety of thin-fleshed pepper, simply transfer them to the serving plate.\nIf using bell peppers, which have thicker flesh and take longer to cook, add 2 tablespoons of water to the pan, cover, and steam for another 2 minutes, or until the peppers are just tender. Set aside on a serving plate.\nIt's time to make the sauce, which only takes a couple minutes. Heat the wok over medium heat and add the oil, garlic and fermented black beans. Stir-fry for a few seconds and add the shaoxing wine. When the wine is bubbly, add the rest of the sauce ingredients (except the cornstarch slurry) and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, add the cornstarch slurry gradually until the sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon. Stir in the reserved scallions and spoon the sauce over the peppers to serve.	30	DairyFree, veryPopular	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/982322-556x370.jpg	8

Butter a 9 X 13 baking dish.In a large bowl beat together 1 cup (2 sticks) of the butter, ¾ cup of the brown sugar, and ½ teaspoon salt until light and fluffy.Blend in the vanilla and then beat in two cups of the flour.Press the dough into the bottom of the prepared pan and bake for 20 minutes, turning halfway through.While the crust is baking, put the frozen raspberries into a medium saucepan with the 2 tablespoons granulated sugar. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally until combined.Whisk the 2 teaspoons of cornstarch into the ½ cup cold water. Pour it into the saucepan and bring it to a slow boil, stirring occasionally.Continue cooking for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.Place the chopped apples, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon lemon juice in another bowl. Toss to coat evenly.Pour the raspberry sauce over the apple mixture (you can strain the seeds out first if you'd like), stir, and then spread it evenly across the baked crust.Using the same bowl you mixed the crust in (for the sake of not having 43,097 dirty dishes), stir together the 1 cup of old fashioned oats, the remaining 1 cup of flour, the remaining ½ cup brown sugar, and the last 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.Melt the remaining ½ cup butter and toss with the oat mixture.Sprinkle the oat crumble over the raspberry apple filling and bake for 25 more minutes.You can scoop this out and serve it hot with ice cream OR you can let it cool completely and slice it into 15-24 dessert bars.	65	Vegetarian	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/517902-556x370.jpg	11

Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top and return to the oven.Bake another 45-50 minutes, until the milk is absorbed, the potatoes are soft and the top and edges are golden and around the edges. (Optional: drain off a bit more of the liquid as using low-fat milk instead cream can result in a bit of wateriness.)Let rest at least 20 minutes before serving so the juices can redistribute.Can be made ahead of time and reheated in the microwave or oven for serving.	85	GlutenFree, veryPopular	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/500795-556x370.jpg	5
70	Cocoa Oat Truffles	Place the oats in the bowl of a food processor and process until finely ground.Add dates, 2 Tbsp cocoa powder, almond butter, vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon and process until finely ground and slightly sticking together (it will form a loose batter).Place remaining cocoa powder in a shallow bowl. Roll truffle mixture into balls (2 or 3 tsp per truffle), pressing firmly for mixture to stick together. Note: if you use 2 tsp per truffle, you will end up with 40 calories per truffle. If you use 3 tsp per truffle, you will end up with 60 calories per truffle. I also spread the “batter” out on a plate because it was easier to scoop up with my 1 tsp measure. After a few presses in between my hands, I ended up with these perfect little cocoa balls. Note: do not roll the batter in your hands (to form a ball) – it will fall apart. Make sure to press it firmly with your fingers/hands until it binds together, kind of like if you were playing with play-dough.Roll truffles in cocoa powder and chill until ready to serve (I chilled mine for about 1 hour).	60	Vegetarian, vegan, glutenFree, dairyFree, veryPopular	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/516542-556x370.jpg	0

91	Homemade Brioche (Oh glorious buttery Brioche)	Start with the sponge. You can heat up the milk in a saucepan, or just pop it in the microwave for about 20 seconds.  Put the milk, yeast, egg, and 1 cup of flour in your stand mixer's bowl.  Mix the ingredients with a spatula until all is blended.  Sprinkle over the other cup of flour to cover the sponge, and let it rest uncovered for 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, there should be cracks in the flour. The cracks let you know that the yeast is working its magic!Good, we are done with the sponge.  Now, what's the deal with the sponge?  It adds a deep flavor and a lovely texture to the bread, and is considered the equivalent of adding another rise to the bread. Now we will turn it into a dough.Add the sugar, salt, eggs, and 1 cup (5 oz) of your flour to the sponge.  Put the bowl in your stand mixer, and using the dough hook, mix on low for 1 minute, until the dough starts to come together.  With the mixer still running on low, add in the remaining 2.5 oz of flour (1/2 cup).  When the flour has been incorporated, bump the speed up to medium, and mix for 15 minutes.  After 10 minutes have passed, the dough should be slapping itself against the side of the bowl.  If it's not, add 3 tbsp more of flour.  Make sure you don't skimp on kneading the dough for 15 minutes.Bash out the butter with a bench scraper on a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap so it's soft and pliable (but not melted or greasy), and turn your mixer down to medium low.  Add the butter a couple tbsp at a time, waiting until each installment of butter is absorbed before adding the next.  And don't be worried if your butter has a hard time incorporating into the dough.  It will be fine.  When all the butter has been added, bump the speed up to medium high for a minute, then reduce to medium and knead the dough for 5 minutes.  The dough should be slapping the bowl again by the end.  The dough will be soft and sticky, and may cling a little bit to the sides of the bowl.Butter a large bowl (I did a 5 qt bowl), and transfer the dough to that bowl, covering the top tightly with plastic wrap.  Let it rise at room temperature for 2 hours, until it has doubled in size.Since yeast tends to clump up, we want to redistribute the yeast.  However, we don't want to deflate the dough too much.  So very gently, with a spatula, turn the dough upside down and around to redistribute the yeast a little bit.  It's fine if it deflates a little bit, just don't purposely bash it down.  Cover again with plastic wrap and let it rise in the refrigerator for 7 hours (you could do as short as 4 hours if it rises enough, but longer rising means more flavor, so it's always best to be patient with bread.  Believe me, I am an impatient lady, so I know it's hard lol).With a sharp knife, gently slice your dough into 3 sections. Cut each section into 6 pieces.  You may gently roll those pieces into balls, but I chose to leave them sort of square.  Place 6 balls in each loaf pan, and cover with plastic wrap.  Let it rise for 2 hours.When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F, and bake for about 30 minutes, until the interior is 200 degrees F on an instant read thermometer.  If during the baking process your brioche browns too much, loosely cover the loaves with tin foil.  Cool on a baking rack, and enjoy!  And make sure you taste some of it when it comes out of the oven...so goooooood!	45	Vegetarian	https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/558875-556x370.jpg	36
